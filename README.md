Flask from Scratch for Data Science Model Deployment :

Welcome to the Flask from Scratch journey! This repository showcases my exploration and hands-on learning of Flask, 
with a primary focus on building web applications specifically designed for deploying data science models. Through this journey,
Iâ€™m diving into essential and advanced Flask concepts, bringing machine learning models to life in a web application environment.

Overview :

This journey focuses on building a comprehensive Flask application from the ground up, making data science models accessible 
and usable in real-world applications. Each module explores critical web development skills, ensuring a robust, scalable,
and production-ready approach to model deployment.

Modules Covered

1. Basic Web Application Building: Setting up Flask from scratch.
2. Dynamic URLs, URL Redirection, and URL Building: Managing routes and creating dynamic web pages.
3. Jinja Templating & Inheritance: Using Jinja2 for flexible and modular layouts.
3. Web Forms & Input Validation: Creating and securing user input.
4. Databases: Integrating SQLite for data management.
