# URL Handling Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of different techniques for handling URLs, including creating dynamic URLs, implementing URL redirection, and building structured URLs for web applications.

## Project Structure

- **dynamic_url.py**: Contains code to generate dynamic URLs based on user inputs.
- **url_redirection.py**: Implements URL redirection, guiding users to alternative URLs when specific pages are inaccessible or undergoing maintenance.
- **url_building.py**: Provides functions for constructing URLs that follow a consistent structure, enhancing navigation and usability.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Dynamic URLs
A dynamic URL is generated automatically based on specific inputs, which enables flexibility in web applications by providing tailored content or pages.

**Usage**:
Dynamic URLs are often used for displaying specific content based on parameters, such as user IDs or query strings.

### 2. URL Redirection
URL redirection is a technique used to guide users from one URL to another, especially in cases where:

- A page is deleted.
- A webpage is under maintenance.
- A website is renamed or restructured.

**Common Response Codes**:
Redirection usually involves HTTP status codes like 301 (permanent redirect) or 302 (temporary redirect).

### 3. URL Building
Building structured URLs helps create a consistent and user-friendly navigation system. Proper URL structure is essential for SEO and enhances the overall user experience.

## How to Run
